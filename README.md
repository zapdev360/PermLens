# PermLens

PermLens provides human-readable visibility into GitHub App permissions and data access using publicly available metadata.

## What PermLens Does
- Explains GitHub App permissions in plain language
- Groups permissions into clear data access categories
- Generates privacy-label-style summaries

## What PermLens Does Not Do
- Inspect application behavior or source code
- Scan repositories or workflows
- Guarantee security, safety, or compliance

PermLens is an informational tool designed to improve transparency, not to audit or enforce policies.

## Status
PermLens is under active development. APIs and schemas may change prior to v1.
